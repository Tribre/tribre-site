      <p class="lead">
        This page speaks to people who see organizations as connected through people and their roles.
        Tribre helps those people link roles across teams and across companies,
        so information moves with less friction and shared purpose turns into shared results.

  <!-- THE VISION -->

      <div>
        <h2>The vision</h2>
        <p>
          People often carry more than one role. Sometimes these roles live in different organizations.
          When that happens, those people naturally become bridges. Work aligns through daily contact,
          information finds the right path, and resources shift to where they matter most.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tribre supports this reality. The platform treats roles as first class objects,
          tracks how they evolve, and makes it easy to share learning across boundaries.
          Redundant effort drops, good patterns spread, decisions improve.
        </p>

      <div>
        <div class="card">
          <div class="kicker">What changes</div>
          <ul>
            <li>Alignment becomes continuous, not tied to weekly or biweekly meetings</li>
            <li>People see where responsibility sits and how information should flow</li>
            <li>Shared playbooks grow with real use, then travel to peers who need them</li>
            <li>Time saves compound because teams reuse what already works</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>The people who bridge the gap</h2>
        <p>
          Some contributors hold similar roles in two places, for example facilitator in a product guild
          and facilitator in a partner community. Others carry two different roles that still relate,
          for example data engineer in one team and analytics coach in another. These people keep
          the conversation going. They are present in the daily work, so alignment does not wait for a calendar slot.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <div class="kicker">What they gain with Tribre</div>
        <ul>
          <li>One place to manage role cards and responsibilities across contexts</li>
          <li>Clear links between inputs and outputs for each role</li>
          <li>Growth paths that reflect both roles and the skills that support them</li>
